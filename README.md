# Out of Office
## Description
This is an app for sharing your vacation experiences, and also reading about experiences of your friends and family!

## User Story
As a user, I want to login into an app in a secure way protecting my email and password. When I want to create a post to share, I can then do so to include things like budget, number of travellers, restaurants, culture, activities, and if pets are travelling with us. When I want to read about experiences of others, I can then go to a page to enjoy others stories!
