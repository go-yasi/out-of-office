# Out of Office
## Description
"Out of Office" is a full-stack application designed for users to read about and share travel experiences.  

The goal of this project was to develop a full-stack application that showcases the skills we've developed over the course of this Coding Bootcamp. It uses Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, Handlebars.js as the template engine, MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database, and GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. The folder structure follows the MVC paradigm and the appplication protects sensitive information with environment variables. The application also uses express-sessions and cookies for user authentication. This site was (proudly!) built completely from scratch, then deployed to Heroku. It was carefully crafted to create a pleasant user experience and is both desktop and mobile friendly. A link to the deployed application can be found below.
